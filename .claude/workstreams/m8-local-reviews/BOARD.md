# M8 board — local-only reviews

**Start here.** This file is the only one that claims to describe *right now*. It wins over any `State` row
in a ticket file; the two change in the same edit.

## In flight right now

**Nothing.** No ticket is dispatched, no branch is open, no agent is running.

_When work starts, list here exactly what is actually running — ticket, unit, branch, agent — and remove each
line the moment it lands. This section is the first thing an interrupted session re-checks._

## Tickets

74 units across 11 tickets. Dependencies below are the **post-review** graph — an adversarial pass over the
ticket set corrected several of them, so this table is authoritative over any earlier sketch.

## Dependency graph

Four layers. Everything in a layer is mutually independent.

**Where the real parallelism is.** M8.1 gates everything — it *is* the spec. After it lands, two tracks run
concurrently on genuinely disjoint packages and never wait on each other:

- **daemon** (`packages/revud`) — M8.2, M8.3, M8.4 mutually independent → M8.5 → M8.8 / M8.10.
- **app** (`packages/app`) — M8.6 → M8.7, needing only the mock, never revud.

They rejoin at M8.9, which needs both. M8.11 closes the milestone and needs everything.

Ticket-level dependencies are a coarse approximation of the real unit-level ones — [M8.8](./tickets/M8.8-resync-and-pinning.md)'s
units 1–3, for instance, are startable after M8.2 + M8.3 alone, ahead of M8.5. The session plan in
[`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) exploits that; it is the authority on execution order, and this graph is the
constraint it must satisfy.

## Exit criteria coverage

Which ticket's `Verify` proves each milestone exit criterion. An exit criterion with no proving ticket is a
gap in the plan, not a gap in the work.

| exit criterion | proved by |
| --- | --- |
| Full loop works with no remote, no token, no network | M8.5, M8.11 |
| Re-sync / amend / rebase keep drafts alive; no mass-`lost` from missing objects | M8.8 |
| Nothing ever reaches GitHub — structurally enforced + asserted | M8.4, M8.11 |
| No synthetic id in `snapshots.pr_number` / `audit_log.pr` / `pr_author.pr` | M8.2 |
| Conformance leg green in every transport; `check` + e2e green | M8.11 |
| No GitHub-flavored affordance on a local review | M8.7 |

## Conventions

- States: `Backlog` · `Todo` · `In Progress` · `In Review` · `Done` (+ `Canceled`).
- A ticket goes `In Review` when its PR is open, `Done` only when **its `Verify` has actually run green**.
- Units are `M8.x.n` inside each ticket file, numbered in default execution order. Append-only — never
  renumber; new units continue the sequence.
- Branch names carry the M-ID. A unit gets its own branch only if it ships as its own PR in a stack.
- The full protocol is [`../README.md`](../README.md).
